# FitnessTracker
# Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker

For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for the following two reasons:

1. Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

2. Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We want you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URL to the deployed application

* The URL to the GitHub repository


## Project title: 14 MVC Tech Blog
This project is a blog about technology. It allows us to create, edit, and add blog posts as well as look at a dashboard of posts and allows users to create a login. 
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to allow for us to make a working blog site uses the MVC techcnology model we learned in unit 14 of the UT coding Bootcamp.
## Build status
Build status of continus integration 

## Code style
Standard
 
## Screenshots

## Tech/framework used
Uses MySql, Sequelize, and Handlebars as well as Javascript.

## Features
Feeatures include login and logout buttons for the users as well as a blog post dashboard. 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
1. Npm init -y.
2. Install dev dependencies.
3. Create MVC database in mysql workbench.
4. Seed database.
5. Create server folder and set up connection for sequelize.
6. Create and edit handlebars.
7. Npm run start. 
8. Deploy to heroku.



## API Reference
None

## Tests
Run tests using npm run start and npm seed to see if the database information has been seeded and check for errors in the server.
