# Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker


> **Important:** Look into using a MongoDB aggregate function to dynamically add up and return the total duration for each workout. Check out the [MongoDB documentation on the $addFields](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/), the [MongoDB documentation on the $sum operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/), and the [Mongoose documentation on aggregate functions](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#aggregate_Aggregate) to learn how it can be accomplished.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)


 
## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to allow for us to make a working fitness appliation using the MVC model as well as new technologies such as Mongod, Mongodb and seeting up back end code for pre-build front end code, we learned in unit 18 of the UT coding Bootcamp.
## Build status
Build status of continous integration 

## Code style
Standard
 
## Screenshots

## Tech/framework used
Uses Mongo, Momgodb,MongoAtlas, Heroku, as well as Javascript.

## Features
Features include dashboard that allows for new and previous workouts. 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
1. Npm install.
2. Install dev dependencies.
3. Create workout schema.
4. Create html routes.
5. Test run in local host server.
6. Npm run start. 
7. Deploy to heroku.



## API Reference
None

## Tests
Run tests using npm run start and npm seed to see if the database information has been seeded and check for errors in the server.
